<h2>Fight Back</h2>
<p>Casual attackers may eventually get bored and move on, but like all
bullies, they will also often revisit previous victims, and even if they
don't, they are likely to pick new ones. If you have been attacked:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Find support.</strong> Being targeted is frightening and wearying,
    particularly if you belong to one of the many groups that are
    targeted in real life as well as online. Let family, friends, and
    colleagues know what is happening so that they can support you. They
    may also be able to offer advice if they have been in similar
    situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use anti-harassment apps</strong> like <a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a> and
    document everything. Save emails and take screenshots of sites
    like Facebook and Twitter (in case attackers delete or alter
    material).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not engage directly.</strong> Casual attackers are often seeking
    attention, so a direct response often encourages further attacks
    (and can draw attention from like-minded attackers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Report the attack.</strong> Social media sites have done everything they
    can to avoid legal accountability for online attacks, but companies
    and universities will usually take what steps they can once they
    know there is a problem. In the authors' experience, they are more
    inclined to take real action against the attacker if they believe
    that you might speak publicly about what has happened and thereby
    damage their reputation, so never agree to a non-disclosure
    agreement that would prevent you from doing so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>It's Not All About You</h2>
<p>Our final rule brings us full circle to the first one. We don't just
wear masks to prevent ourselves from becoming infected: we also wear
them so that we will not infect others. Similarly, if you do not take
precautions with online security then you are putting others at risk.
Simple steps like putting passwords on PDFs that contain sensitive
information can go a long way to deter attackers, in the same way that a
sturdy-looking bike lock encourages would-be thieves to go after some
other bike. And if you <em>are</em> compromised, let those affected know as
soon as you can.</p>
<p>The only long-term way to improve everyone's online safety is to
pressure politicians to strengthen liability legislation so that
companies, universities, and other institutions have real incentives to
take meaningful action. Cars and drugs are as safe as they are because
their manufacturers are liable for negligence and harm. The sooner
software companies and social media sites are liable as well, the safer
all of us will be.</p>
