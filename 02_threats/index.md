# Threat Models

Edward Snowden and the journalists who worked with him took
extraordinary measures to safeguard themselves against **state-level
actors** [@Snow2019], but most of us aren't involved in issues of
national security and don't need to take those kinds of precautions.
Instead, we typically face one of three kinds of threat illustrated by
the examples below.

-   **Casual threats** are opportunistic. For example, Monica, a
    professor in psychology, is targeted by Mohan, an undergraduate in
    computer science who spends hours every day in online echo chambers
    complaining about how "SJW bullshit" is ruining tech. He really
    didn't enjoy Monica's guest lecture on discrimination and
    inclusivity in his software engineering class, and thinks it would
    be a laugh to make her the target of anonymous abuse online. He is
    unlikely to invest significant effort in his attack (at least not
    initially), but his attack may be backed up by more knowledgeable
    members of online forums. They are almost certainly not computer
    security specialists; instead, they are probably older versions of
    Mohan who have picked up a few tricks and bits of software and enjoy
    the digital equivalent of throwing bricks through strangers'
    windows.

-   **Intimate threats** come from people who know their targets'
    passwords or have a chance to install spyware on their targets'
    devices [@Leit2019]. For example, Elena, graduate student, is
    targeted by her former romantic partner Eric, who is also a graduate
    student but not in the same department. Their relationship had
    become increasingly abusive over the last two years. With the help
    of friends, Elena has moved out of their shared apartment and is
    rebuilding her life; Eric is obsessed with the idea that she left
    him for someone else and is now stalking her.

-   **Insider threats** come from people who have legitimate access to
    accounts and devices. For example, Boris, professor of medicine, is
    targeted by Bethany, who works for the university's IT department.
    Boris has agreed to serve as an expert witness in an upcoming
    liability case involving a large chemical company; Bethany has been
    asked by a former colleague to find out what he is going to say in
    order to discredit his testimony.
