# Threat Models

Edward Snowden and the journalists who worked with him took
extraordinary measures to safeguard themselves against
[state-level actors](g:state-level-actor) [[Snowden2019](b:Snowden2019)],
but most of us aren't involved in issues of national security and
don't need to take those kinds of precautions.  Instead, we typically
face one of three kinds of threat illustrated by the examples below.

-   [Casual threats](g:casual-threat) are opportunistic. For example,
    Monica, a professor in psychology, is targeted by Mohan, an
    undergraduate in computer science who spends hours every day in
    online echo chambers complaining about how "SJW bullshit" is
    ruining tech. He really didn't enjoy Monica's guest lecture on
    discrimination and inclusivity in his software engineering class,
    and thinks it would be a laugh to make her the target of anonymous
    abuse online. He is unlikely to invest significant effort in his
    attack (at least not initially), but his attack may be backed up
    by more knowledgeable members of online forums. They are almost
    certainly not computer security specialists; instead, they are
    probably older versions of Mohan who have picked up a few tricks
    and bits of software and enjoy the digital equivalent of throwing
    bricks through strangers' windows.

-   [Intimate threats](g:intimate-threat) come from people who know
    their targets' passwords or have a chance to install spyware on
    their targets' devices [[Leitão2019](b:Leitão2019)]. For example,
    Elena, graduate student, is targeted by her former romantic
    partner Eric, who is also a graduate student but not in the same
    department. Their relationship had become increasingly abusive
    over the last two years. With the help of friends, Elena has moved
    out of their shared apartment and is rebuilding her life; Eric is
    obsessed with the idea that she left him for someone else and is
    now stalking her.

-   [Insider threats](g:insider-threat) come from people who have
    legitimate access to accounts and devices. For example, Boris,
    professor of medicine, is targeted by Bethany, who works for the
    university's IT department.  Boris has agreed to serve as an
    expert witness in an upcoming liability case involving a large
    chemical company; Bethany has been asked by a former colleague to
    find out what he is going to say in order to discredit his
    testimony.
