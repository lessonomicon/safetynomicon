# Introduction

Researchers studying everything from sexual health to COVID-19 to gun
violence are increasingly likely to be targeted because of their work.
While research institutions have rules and guidelines for safeguarding
sensitive information, these usually do not address the problem of
keeping *individuals* safe from either targeted attacks like Climategate
[@Natu2010] or the kinds of "drive-by" threats that everyone now faces
regardless of their occupation.

Hollywood depictions of everyday threats are as far from reality as
their portrayals of scientists, but more realistic guidance for personal
digital security is now freely available [@FLD; @EFJ2015; @EFF]. The ten
quick tips in this paper are a starting point: while they apply to
everyone, they were developed with researchers in mind. While
researchers expect their work to be scrutinized by the academic
community, they should not expect to endure harassment due to the
visibility of their published works. These rules do not guarantee
complete safety, any more than seatbelts guarantee safe driving, but
following them greatly reduces the likelihood of harm.

## Put On Your Own Mask

The first and most important rule is that we should not rely on
companies, universities, and other institutions to protect us, for the
simple reason that they are not penalized if they don't. As recently as
ten years ago we could blame the lack of meaningful institutional
liability for data breaches on the law being slow to catch up with
rapidly-changing technology. Accountability for these breaches is
practically non-existent: data breaches have minimal impact on
companies' profitability and individuals are almost never fined, much
less jailed.

Much of what institutions force us to go through is
[security theater](g:security-theater) intended to make us believe
something is being done rather than to actually make us
safer. Requiring people to take off their shoes at airports is one
example; random searches of backpacks and bags at the entrance to the
subway is another, since it's hard to imagine that a would-be attacker
*wouldn't* just go to another entrance. (Bruce Schneier's blog
[@SchnBlog] has many examples of security theater and the harm it
does.)

Security theater is counter-productive because it encourages us to cut
corners in ways that actually make us *less* safe. For example, forcing
people to change passwords every three months encourages people to
choose memorable (and therefore easy-to-guess) passwords.

# Digital Security is Rarely the Weakest Link

The second rule is to remember that most attacks take place offline, and
that the most effective ones are often the simplest. At an airport
several years ago, one author heard a professor of computer science try
to reset an online account over the phone. In just a couple of minutes,
they had inadvertently told everyone in the lounge their full name,
their date of birth, the three-digit verification code on the back of
their credit card, and what was almost certainly their mother's maiden
name.

The moral of this story is that safety comes from good habits, not
technology. [Social engineering](g:social-engineering) is far more
common than hacking: in practice it is far easier to trick someone
into giving you their password than to break into their devices
digitally.

The key practice is [situational awareness](g:situational-awareness),
which is a fancy way of saying, "Pay attention to what's happening and
respond accordingly." If you start working on a high-profile subject
that will likely attract controversy you should take more precautions
than usual. For example, someone should recognize that agreeing to be
an expert witness increases the odds that they will be targeted, and
should be more careful about what he puts into email while preparing
and delivering his testimony.

The corollary to situational awareness is to de-escalate when you can.
Being on guard all the time is exhausting and quickly leads to
[security fatigue](g:security-fatigue) [@Stan2016]. If you are too
tired to follow good practices, knowing them does you no good.

Two technologies that are useful, but only to a certain extent, are
Virtual Private Networks and a specialized web browser called Tor. A
Virtual Private Network (VPN) connects your device to a server, then has
the server make connections to other machines on your behalf. All
messages between your device and the server are encrypted, and the
server can be managed by professional IT staff in a jurisdiction with
tight privacy laws to increase your safety. Tor routes messages randomly
through a network of servers, making traffic much harder to track. Both
reduce risk, but neither eliminates it if your device is compromised, if
the VPN is subpoenaed, or if you log in to accounts over Tor (thereby
revealing your identity to those sites).
