## Structure

-   Lessons are in `nn_slug` directories
    -   `nn` is two-digit sequence number
    -   `slug` is short mnemonic
-   Each lesson must have:
    -   `index.md`: lesson content
    -   `Makefile`: re-run tasks
        -   Should `include ../common.mk` to get common tasks
    -   Symbolic links `data`, `migrations`, and `static`
        to the `./data`, `./migrations`, and `./static` directories in the project root
    -   Lessons may have a `slides.md` file containing slides
    -   Diagrams should be SVG files created with [draw.io][draw-io]
-   `bibliography.md` has the bibliography as a definition list
    -   Citation keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use an inline HTML link `b:key` in files to create links
-   `glossary.md` has the glossary as definition list
    -   Reference keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use an inline HTML link `g:key` in files to create links
-   The `static` directory contains static files
    -   `page.css`: CSS for website pages
    -   `slides.css` and `slides.js`: simple HTML slides
    -   Other CSS and JavaScript files used in lessons
-   The `templates` directory contains [Jinja][jinja] templates used to generate HTML
    -   `page.html`: template for website pages
    -   `slides.html`: template for simple HTML slides

Please use [Conventional Commits][conventional] style for pull requests
by using `change:`, `feature:`, `fix:`, or `task:` as the first word
in the title of the commit message.
You may also use `publish:` if the PR just rebuilds the HTML version of the lesson.
